Interactive note thing

Trying to make watching videos less shit

What next?

* N to note maybe
  * overlay, autopause, don't leave ya keyboard
* end-of-vid review
* Spaced repetition?
* Save yer marks somehow
* Better way of doing vids
* Would be GREAT to chunk captions together into actually sensible chunks o text
* Maybe notes after in the review??
